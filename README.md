# Higher Diploma in Science - Data Analytics  
# Applied Statistics – Assessment

This repository contains my work for the Applied Statistics assessment. All problems are solved inside the problems.ipynb notebook. The aim is to use simulations, basic statistical ideas, and clear explanations. This assessment focuses on using simulations and statistical reasoning to explore the problems outlined in the module.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed.

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   Windows:  
   python -m venv venv  
   venv\Scripts\activate  

   macOS / Linux:  
   python3 -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  

3. Install the requirements:  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  

4. Launch Jupyter:  
   jupyter lab  
   or  
   jupyter notebook  

5. Open problems.ipynb and run the cells from top to bottom.

## Notes

- Each problem has its own heading.  
- Code cells are small and commented.  
- Markdown cells explain what I am doing and why.  
- Simulations use NumPy (official docs: https://numpy.org/doc/).  
- Plots for some problems are created with matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/).  
- The work is written for someone with a computing background.

## Version Control

Commits are added gradually to show steady progress. Each commit focuses on one change or one problem at a time.

If anything fails during setup, the environment is lightweight and should work on any machine with Python and Jupyter installed.
